# Jun 2022

This folder contains my final files for the Jun 2022 tabular playground series competition.

The competition goal was to predict missing values.

The files in this repository are :

- CV lightGBM.Rmd: Cross validation for LightGBM
- CV_NN.Rmd: Cross validation with Deep Learning
- Model_by_NA_count_LGBM_NN.Rmd: Training by NA count with LightGBM
- Model_mean_median.Rmd: Mean / median imputation for variables F_1 and F_3
- NN_by_NA_combination: Model by NA combination with multiple outputs
- NN_by_NA_count_filled_with_-1.Rmd: Model by NA count with alteration of the training set with -1 to replace NAs
